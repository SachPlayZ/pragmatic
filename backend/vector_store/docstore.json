But rather than spell doom, these cycles can be used by savvy investors to enhance their proﬁts.\r\nPersonally, I love down markets because they make buying much\r\neasier.

Similar to FHA,VA loans offer liberal qualifying guidelines. Many (but not all) VA lenders will forgive properly explained credit blemishes. The VA loan also permits higher\r\nqualifying ratios. I’ve seen veterans with good compensating factors close loans with a 0.48 total debt ratio. (See Chapter 8.)\r\n◆ Closing costs paid. Often homebuilders and cooperative sellers will pay all of the veteran’s settlement expenses.

But even if your state doesn’t yet mandate seller disclosure, you still should obtain a disclosure form (most major realty ﬁrms\r\nkeep blank copies on hand) and ask the owners to ﬁll it out. In reviewing a completed disclosure statement, however, keep in mind the following ﬁve trouble points:\r\n1. Sellers are not required to disclose facts or conditions of\r\nwhich they are unaware.\r\n2. Disclosure reveals the past.

For you, their desire to sell quickly may mean their\r\nloss and your gain.\r\n◆ ◆ ◆\r\n\r\nIn sum, the three stages of the foreclosure process offers you these\r\npossibilities to gain a bargain price or bargain terms:\r\n1.\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n\r\nYou can negotiate with the distressed property owners and, if\r\nnecessary, the foreclosing lender.\r\nYou can bid at the foreclosure auction.","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":343,"totalChunks":1240}}],["7e738818-3292-4326-9000-745b382290a9",{"pageContent":"1.\r\n2.\r\n3.\r\n\r\nYou can negotiate with the distressed property owners and, if\r\nnecessary, the foreclosing lender.\r\nYou can bid at the foreclosure auction.\r\nYou can negotiate and buy directly from the lender or its insuring agency (FHA, VA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac) that owns\r\nthe property as an REO.\r\n\r\nApproach Owners with Empathy: Step One\r\nThere’s no magic system that you can use to buy a property from owners facing foreclosure.

No matter what negotiating style you choose to\r\nget what you want, you will run bluffs, drag red herrings across the other\r\nparty’s path, create subtle ways to extract information, and protest that\r\nyou cannot pay more even though you know full well that you are willing and able to do so.\r\nYou Win; the Other Party Feels Like a Winner In the real world\r\nversion of win-win, you avoid the hostile,“rip your face off” negotiating\r\n\r\n\fWin What You Want through Negotiation\r\n\r\n223","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":519,"totalChunks":1240}}],["41268299-6ff1-4cd1-ba33-5b341eaee48c",{"pageContent":"You Win; the Other Party Feels Like a Winner In the real world\r\nversion of win-win, you avoid the hostile,“rip your face off” negotiating\r\n\r\n\fWin What You Want through Negotiation\r\n\r\n223\r\n\r\nstyle so common to New York lawyers.

The section below explores three of the most common strategies that\r\nyou can use to make money with these vehicles.\r\n\r\nBuy & Hold\r\nPerhaps the most common form of investing, the \"buy and hold strategy\" involves\r\npurchasing a property and renting it out for an extended period of time. It's\r\nprobably the most simple and purest form of real estate investing that there is.\r\nEssentially, a \"buy and hold investor\" seeks to create wealth by renting the\r\nproperty out and either collecting monthly cash flow or simply holding the\r\nproperty until it can be sold for a gain in the future.

Among the advantages of this\r\nstrategy is that during the time that you hold the property and rent it out, the\r\nmortgage is paid down each and every month, decreasing your principal balance\r\nand increasing your equity in the property.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important things for a new buy and hold investor to understand is how to evaluate deals\r\nand opportunities. By far the most common mistake that we see new investors make with this strategy is\r\nbuying bad deals because they simply don't understand property evaluation. Other common problems\r\ninclude underestimating expenses, making bad decisions on tenant selection, and failing to manage properly.\r\nThese mistakes can all be avoided, however, if you simply learn the business; jumping in without proper\r\neducation can be extremely costly financially and sometimes, legally.\r\nTo properly carry out the buy and hold strategy, an investor should learn how to properly identify the ebbs","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":752,"totalChunks":1240}}],["4bbb1184-6bbf-41dc-8033-83e9c5683f6f",{"pageContent":"education can be extremely costly financially and sometimes, legally.\r\nTo properly carry out the buy and hold strategy, an investor should learn how to properly identify the ebbs\r\nand flows of the market that a property is located in.

When the market becomes over-heated, an experienced buy and hold investor\r\nwill usually stop buying until they see things settle back down. During these slow periods, they may sell or\r\nsimply continue to hold their properties.

Following a rule of thumb known as the\r\n70% rule, an experienced house flipper will buy a home for 70% of its current value less any rehab costs.

You\r\nsimply need to pick one strategy and become a master of it. That strategy (vehicle), if dependable, will carry\r\nyou through to your destination (your goals). If you are choosing to flip homes to generate cash in order to\r\nsave up enough to quit your job – write that down.

Be realistic, but don't\r\nbe afraid to reach, either. Do you want to retire in ten years? Are you planning\r\non quitting your job next month? Document your timeline here. You can do this\r\nin accordance with your goals, as mentioned above.\r\nMarket - Define your market. What kind of property will you be looking for?\r\nLow income? High Income? Commercial areas? As a beginner, choose an area\r\nyou feel most comfortable with.

You'll want to define your loan to value, cash flow requirements, max purchase amount, max\r\nrehab amount, max timeframe, etc. (these are all items you'll pick up as we go further). One of the most\r\nimportant lessons you can possibly learn is to stick to your criteria and walk away from any deal that does\r\nnot meet your criteria.

You'll learn more about these areas of criteria in chapter 5. This part of your business plan is one of\r\nthe most important to fully understand and clearly define. Too many new investors get excited and buy the\r\nfirst deal that comes their way. By having clearly defined criteria, you are able to easily reject the 99% of\r\nproperties that are not a good deal.\r\nMarketing Plan - How are you going to create a marketing system so motivated sellers come to you?

Don't try to pinch pennies by ignoring this valuable member of your\r\nteam. You don't need to meet for hours with your attorney each week, but want someone to be available\r\nwhen you need them. Having an attorney who is skilled with real estate investing is highly important for the\r\nsuccess of your career.

Using the 70% rule, a person should multiply $200,000 by 70% to get\r\n$140,000 - and then subtract the $35,000 in repairs. The most a person should pay for this property,\r\ntherefore, should be $105,000.\r\nRemember, a rule of thumb, like the ones above, is used only to quickly and efficiently screen a property and\r\ndecide if it's worth further investigation.

Banks and other lending\r\ninstitutions have many different products, such as a Home Equity Installment\r\nLoan (HEIL) or a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) that allow you to tap into\r\nthe equity you've already got. For example, an investor may purchase a\r\nproperty, but instead of going through the normal hassle of trying to finance the\r\ninvestment property itself, they can instead take out a HELOC on their own\r\nhome to pay for the property.\r\nIn order to obtain a home equity loan or line of credit, you must first have equity in your home.

The ownership stake provided by the equity partner may allow that partner to\r\nactively participate in nearly all aspects of property ownership.

If it makes a lot of money then, their\r\nreturn will be higher, but if the investment loses money, they may have to contribute money to keep the\r\nproperty afloat. Equity partners take a higher risk than a private lender might, but in return, they have the\r\npotential of making significantly more when the investment is successful.

It is important\r\nto note that when networking with others, it is not about\r\n\"what can I get out of it,\" but rather \"how can I contribute\r\nto the conversation?\"\r\n\r\n Hang out on our forums, asking questions when needed, and answering others when you\r\n\r\ncan.

You don't need to have a presence on every single\r\nnetwork, but focusing on one or two is better than being non-existent on all of them. The\r\ntrick to networking via social media, however, is to not use it as an advertising platform.\r\nSocial media is about creating relationships, so spend your time building solid relationships,\r\nand make a name for yourself as someone with knowledge.\r\n\r\n Blogging -- A blog is simply an online collection of articles, ordered from newest to oldest.

People use marketing funnels in\r\nnearly every form of business, and real estate investing is no different.\r\nYou are probably familiar with a \"funnel,\" often used for pouring\r\nlarge amounts of liquid into a small space, such as when putting\r\noil in a vehicle.

At the top, the funnel is at its widest, collecting\r\nthe most amount of whatever substance you are capturing. As\r\nthe substance moves down the funnel, it gets smaller and smaller\r\nuntil it comes out the bottom into whatever container you are\r\npouring it into. In the same way, your marketing funnel will seek\r\nto bring in the most amount of people at the top, and through\r\nprogressive steps, your funnel will get more specific until you\r\nhave a much smaller number of people left to produce your\r\ndesired goal.\r\nThe kind of marketing funnel you set will depend greatly on the\r\nkind of investing you get into. A marketing funnel for a\r\nwholesaler is going to be significantly different than that of a\r\nnote buyer, but perhaps with similar themes. For example, a\r\nwholesalers funnel may look a lot like this:\r\n70 | Real Estate Marketing\r\n\r\n\f Send out postcards to individuals who are past due on their mortgage.","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":861,"totalChunks":1240}}],["882c1823-c7f4-4f13-a06e-18adcaecc489",{"pageContent":"wholesalers funnel may look a lot like this:\r\n70 | Real Estate Marketing\r\n\r\n\f Send out postcards to individuals who are past due on their mortgage.\r\n Set up a 1-800 voicemail number for people to call for foreclosure help.\r\n Allow people to leave a voicemail if they want more information about selling their\r\n\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n Call individuals who left a message and screen for possible good leads.\r\n Meet with the good leads and make offers.\r\n Get offers accepted and sign a purchase and sale agreement.\r\n Do due diligence.\r\n Close on the property.\r\nNotice that in each step, the funnel narrows. At the start, perhaps five thousand people receive mailers. Out\r\nof them, perhaps only a hundred people make the phone call to the number on your postcards. Out of that\r\nhundred, only twenty leave a voicemail, of which only four warrant a personal visit and an offer. Finally,\r\nperhaps one or two of those offers may actually result in a signed deal for the wholesaler.","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":862,"totalChunks":1240}}],["a08e32f1-fd1d-49db-b1ce-a105838c47fa",{"pageContent":"perhaps one or two of those offers may actually result in a signed deal for the wholesaler.\r\nWhile it may seem like a drastic waste, that one or two deals may result in a huge financial windfall for the\r\nwholesaler.

As mentioned above, your\r\nmarketing funnel may differ quite a bit from the above funnel.\r\nAs a real estate investor, you need to be constantly measuring and tweaking your marketing funnel. You can\r\nand should test your funnel to continually increase conversions -- the percentage of people who make it all\r\nthe way through the funnel to your desired outcome.\r\nFor example (to draw from the wholesale funnel example above), you could get two separate phone\r\nnumbers, split the group of past-due homeowners in half, sending half the postcards to one group and half\r\nto the other and measure the results.

This form of marketing is known as\r\n\"direct mail.\" Direct mail is simply the process of sending letters to\r\ntargeted individuals through the mail, in hopes that a small\r\npercentage will respond to those letters. Whether you are a\r\nwholesaler, flipper, or buy and hold investor, your business is\r\ndependent upon finding great deals and having a consistent supply of leads for those deals.

For many investors, it is their number one source of leads.\r\n\r\nHow Does Direct Mail Work?\r\nDirect mail campaigns are designed to build awareness of your product or service over time. Think back to\r\none of the last purchases you made, such as a drink at Starbucks, a movie you rented, or a song you\r\npurchased from iTunes. Chances are, you didn't buy that item the first time you heard about it. Most folks\r\nsimply don’t buy from a business the first time they come across it. Therefore, a direct mail campaign cannot\r\nbe a simple \"one and done\" campaign. By sending messages over the course of time, the recipients become\r\nfamiliar with you and your service or product, and some will respond as you become the solution to their\r\nneeds.","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":865,"totalChunks":1240}}],["ffce0b7b-699e-4aa8-b860-3d6144abe5c7",{"pageContent":"familiar with you and your service or product, and some will respond as you become the solution to their\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nHow Do I Build a List to Send to?\r\nYou can build your list by using public records provided by your local county assessor, or you can hire an\r\nonline company, like Listsource, to get your list for you. While using the pubic records is free, using an online\r\ncompany may save you time, so keep your goals in mind as you begin creating your list. Do note that you\r\nneed to have your list re-done every six months or so to keep it fresh, as the market is continually changing.\r\nYou will need to get rid of those folks that are no longer candidates for your particular list, and you will want\r\nto add in new people.\r\n\r\nWhat Do I Send? There are two primary options that investors tend to mail to potential leads.

Direct mail can be sent to\r\nvirtually anyone, so you'll need to look at your funnel and decide. The following is a list of a few different\r\ntypes of people you may want to target:\r\n Absentee Owners.

You can oftentimes find a way to create a \"win-win\"\r\nsituation to help these individuals save their credit and snag a great deal for yourself.\r\n\r\n Apartment Owners. If you are looking to get into apartment buying, mailing to apartment\r\n\r\nowners can be a great way to stay on their radar.

The majority of their revenue comes\r\nfrom their online advertising platforms. As an investor, you can use these sources to target potential sellers,\r\nbuyers, or other business interactions. While Facebook and Google ads may look fairly similar, they differ in\r\nseveral key ways:\r\n\r\n73 | Real Estate Marketing\r\n\r\n\f Facebook allows you to target who sees your ad based on their interests, location,\r\n\r\ndemographics, and connections on Facebook.\r\n\r\n Google allows you to target who sees your ad based on their searches, web history, and\r\n\r\nlocation.","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":871,"totalChunks":1240}}],["74fc8c59-382f-427f-bfc9-6c6b8d456511",{"pageContent":"demographics, and connections on Facebook.\r\n\r\n Google allows you to target who sees your ad based on their searches, web history, and\r\n\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of these kinds of online ads is that you can set it up so you only pay when the ad works.\r\nImagine asking a local newspaper to only charge you when someone calls about your ad. There's no chance\r\nof that happening. However, this is exactly what this kind of online advertising allows you to do. This is\r\nknown as “pay-per-click” advertising, which means you only pay when someone clicks on an ad and goes to\r\nyour site. With pay-per-click advertising (such as ads on Facebook, Google, or Bing), you only have to pay for\r\nthe ad when your advertisement accomplished its goal of placing people in your marketing funnel.\r\n\r\nBenefits of Online Pay-Per-Click Advertising\r\n Most online pay-per-click advertisements allow you to be\r\n\r\nlocation specific – which means you can choose to have","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":872,"totalChunks":1240}}],["88aa56d9-945a-4a69-8966-9456b9dbdcd7",{"pageContent":"Benefits of Online Pay-Per-Click Advertising\r\n Most online pay-per-click advertisements allow you to be\r\n\r\nlocation specific – which means you can choose to have\r\nyour advertisement seen only by individuals within ten, a\r\nhundred, or any number of miles of your specified location.\r\n\r\n Additionally, Facebook ads are interest-specific. (Do you\r\n\r\nreally believe Facebook’s “like” feature is only for the user's\r\nbenefit?) Facebook uses those “likes” and friendship\r\nrelationships to help marketers reach certain people. This\r\nmeans, as a real estate marketer, you can choose to show\r\nyour ad only to people who are interested in a certain topic.\r\n\r\n Finally, most pay-per-click advertising (especially Facebook) is demographically-specific, so\r\n\r\nyou can advertise to specific ages or genders.

Marketers then compete for either keywords or interests, based on the criteria you are targeting\r\nyour advertising to. When you set up a new ad, you will tell Facebook, Google or Bing what price per click you\r\nwant to pay, and you'll generally never be charged more than that.

In the world of real\r\nestate agents, the \"80/20 Principle\" often\r\nseems to hold true - that 20% of the agents\r\nsell 80% of the listings. It's important to find\r\nthat 20% and allow them to work their magic.\r\nWhen you choose the agent you want to list\r\nyour property, you will typically sign a \"listing\r\nagreement\" with the agent, giving them the\r\nright to earn the commission if they sell the\r\nhome.

At this point, you will decide what price the property should be listed for. Pricing is very\r\nimportant, as you do not want to list too high (adding months to your holding time) or too low (leaving\r\nmoney on the table.) A good agent should be able to look at other similar properties and determine the best\r\nprice to list at.\r\nThe listing agreement also spells out the commission to be earned by the agent. The typical commission for a\r\nreal estate agent is 6% (though that can change slightly, depending on price, property type, and location.)\r\nThis fee is usually split 50/50 with the agent who brought the buyer.

However, this is not the case. There are many tricks and techniques that you, as the seller, can do to\r\nensure the property sells for the highest amount, the soonest.

Instead of 6%, it usually will end up being around 3% out of pocket.\r\n\r\nSelling Using Seller Financing\r\nSeller financing (also known as \"carrying the contract\") takes place when an\r\nowner sells a property to a buyer but carries the mortgage rather than\r\nrequiring the buyer to get their own mortgage. This is done by many\r\ninvestors all over the world for a variety of reasons and across different\r\ninvestment types.

The current lending atmosphere can make it tough for many buyers to obtain traditional\r\nfinancing. They may not be able to document all of their income, they may be self employed, or may have\r\nsome blemishes on their credit reports.\r\n79 | Real Estate Exit Strategies\r\n\r\n\fKeep in mind that seller financing isn't only for the benefit of buyers who normally don't qualify for a\r\nmortgage.

Many investors choose to sell off their properties using seller financing because they want to\r\nreceive monthly income that doesn't involve maintenance, tenants, or rentals. When a property is sold via\r\nseller financing, the property is 100% the new buyer's responsibility, and with that comes all the rights and\r\nexpenses that come with ownership (including taxes, insurance, and maintenance).\r\nA seller may also choose to use seller financing in order to offset the taxes due at the end of their investment\r\ncareer, as the IRS classifies this as an \"installment sale\" and allows the seller to spread out any capital gains\r\ntaxes that may be due. See your tax advisor for more information on the tax benefits of seller financing.\r\n\r\nHow to Use Seller Financing:\r\nWhen offering seller financing, the seller should require a large non-refundable down payment up front to\r\nprotect their interest and to prevent against the the likelihood that the buyer will stop making their monthly","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":890,"totalChunks":1240}}],["145669a8-7697-432d-8b54-9ce337ac11f4",{"pageContent":"protect their interest and to prevent against the the likelihood that the buyer will stop making their monthly\r\npayments. The higher the down payment, the lower the risk to the seller. For example, if a seller requires a\r\n$1,000 down payment, there is not a lot of incentive for the buyer to uphold their obligations. However, if the\r\ndown payment required is $30,000, there is a lot more incentive to perform. Additionally, it is important that\r\nthe seller goes through the same process as they would during a normal sale, using a title company,\r\nattorneys, and other legal paperwork to ensure the sale is done correctly.\r\n\r\nWho Can Sell With Seller Financing?\r\nSeller financing is generally only applicable if the home is currently owned without a mortgage.

For more on notes, search BiggerPockets.\r\n\r\nWhat Are Risks of Using Seller Financing?\r\nThe largest risk of selling with seller financing is having your buyer stop making payments at some point,\r\nwhereby you, the seller, will have to foreclose. In this case, you are subject to the same laws and foreclosure\r\nprocess as any other lending institution, which takes time and money.

You do that by screening the buyer carefully, so that you are fully aware of any issues\r\nthat might arise. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the best way to reduce your risk is to get as high of a\r\ndown payment as possible. The more money you receive up front, the less likely you are to have problems.\r\nAlso be sure to check out:\r\n•\r\n\r\nBP Podcast 013 – Buying Real Estate with Seller Financing and Speculating with Leon Yang\r\n\r\n80 | Real Estate Exit Strategies\r\n\r\n\fUsing Lease Options\r\nAnother Option used by investors as an exit strategy is known as the \"lease option\" or \"lease purchase.\" This","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":893,"totalChunks":1240}}],["6fb76ec7-9b0c-4448-a141-89ba57c137e6",{"pageContent":"80 | Real Estate Exit Strategies\r\n\r\n\fUsing Lease Options\r\nAnother Option used by investors as an exit strategy is known as the \"lease option\" or \"lease purchase.\" This\r\narrangement is actually two separate parts: the lease and the option.\r\nThe lease is just like any other rental lease, where the tenant moves into the home and makes monthly rent\r\npayments.\r\nThe option is a legal agreement that gives the tenant the legal right to buy the home at a pre-determined\r\nprice in a pre-determined length of time.

Tenants can also be made responsible for small repairs in\r\npreparation for their becoming homeowners.\r\n\r\nNo Real Estate Commission Required.","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":897,"totalChunks":1240}}],["ea539a19-1538-4e28-9a31-9ebb10f65998",{"pageContent":"better care of the property than a typical renter.

The language in the law that determines\r\nwhen a bank can trigger the due on sale clause is cloudy at best, and while this may be a gray area, it is\r\nultimately up to the bank to decide if they want to call the note due and force you to pay back the entire loan\r\nwithin 30 days. Should this happen, you could challenge this in court, but that also would require significant\r\nfinancial resources.\r\n\r\nYou Can't Sell the Property to Anyone Else.\r\nDuring the option period, the tenant has the exclusive right to buy the home. If prices suddenly rise, you are\r\nlocked in at a certain price with the tenant and cannot sell for more. Also, if the market begins to drop and go\r\ndownhill, you cannot sell to get out of the deal, either until the \"option\" is no longer binding.\r\n\r\nYou Could Be Sued.\r\nThere is a story on the BiggerPockets blog about an investor who was sued by a tenant, who claimed (after","metadata":{"category":"real_estate","language":"english","source":"data.txt","chunk":899,"totalChunks":1240}}],["1490e8c0-25a8-4926-8f3d-0a9c254d8332",{"pageContent":"You Could Be Sued.\r\nThere is a story on the BiggerPockets blog about an investor who was sued by a tenant, who claimed (after\r\nbeing evicted for not exercising their option to buy) he had \"equity\" in the home.

As a result, some unscrupulous investors have used the lease option strategy to take\r\nadvantage of tenants, offering a lease option to individuals who will never qualify for a mortgage and\r\ncharging outrageously high option fees and short terms, just hoping the tenant doesn't buy.
